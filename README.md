# MuseumsAquariumsZoos
I worked on a project that involves a dataset dealing with museums, aquariums, and zoos. The dataset is from kaggle. I was more focused on the revenue, income, and Tax Period. There were alot of other columns but they were categorical. I did some data cleaning first before having to examine the data very closely. I made a bar chart of how many certain museum types there were. I also made a scatter plot showing the relationship between income and revenue. i even made a histogram showing the revenue for the places. I used the programming language, R when working on this.
